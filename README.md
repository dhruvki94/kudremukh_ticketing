<h>E-Gate</h>
This is an E-Gate app used by Kudremukh National Park to monitor the vehicles entering the premises. 
It has a QR Code scanner that allows the Forest Officers to map a vehicle with a QR Code and allows for a quick exit for the vehicle by simply giving the QR Code back.
There is a Loss Of QR Code button that allows for searching all active vehicles in case QR code is lost.
